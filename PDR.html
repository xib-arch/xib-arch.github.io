    <!-- ================= Problem Statement ================= -->
    <section id="problem">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <div class="box">
        Many boat owners and people who want to enjoy the ocean feel unsafe. There are multiple reports in Florida and other places where people fall off boats. Especially Florida waterways are becoming too dangerous for our community. Between 2014–2025 there have been at least 8 such fatal cases.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- ================= Justification Synthesis ================= -->
    <section id="justification">
      <h2>Justification Statement</h2>
      <div class="box">
        Fatal boating accidents caused by captains falling overboard and failing to use safety lanyards remain a serious and preventable problem. In June 2025, two men were thrown from a boat in New Jersey’s Barnegat Bay after hitting a wake. The unmanned vessel circled back and fatally struck an elderly man in the water (CBS News, 2025). Just two months earlier in Indiana, a 71-year-old man was killed by a propeller after being ejected from his boat under similar circumstances (Fox8, 2025). These tragedies highlight a recurring pattern: when operators are ejected, boats without engine cutoff devices can become deadly projectiles. Law enforcement has noted that a simple tool—the engine cut-off switch lanyard—could prevent many of these incidents. In Sarasota Bay, for example, police confirmed that a runaway boat incident could have been avoided if the captain had been wearing the kill-switch lanyard (WFLA, 2025). Despite federal regulations requiring manufacturers to install engine cut-off switches on new boats, compliance among operators remains inconsistent, leaving a gap between safety technology and actual practice.
        <br><br>
        The consequences are clear: lives are being lost due to a problem with a simple, proven solution. Addressing this gap requires not only enforcement and education but also innovations that make cutoff systems more intuitive and harder to ignore. Marine safety experts such as Capt. Chris Day (U.S. Coast Guard) and organizations like the National Safe Boating Council could provide valuable feedback on practical solutions and adoption strategies. Their professional input would help ensure that future safety designs or awareness campaigns directly address the behavioral and technical shortcomings currently leading to preventable deaths.

    <!-- ================= Mission Statement ================= -->
    <section id="mission">
      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <div class="box">
        In South Florida, boating accidents are occurring daily and these numbers are increasing every year. Many people are becoming more concerned about going out into the beautiful ocean of South Florida. Our goal is to make Florida waterways a safer place so everyone can experience the amazing offerings of nature that God gave us. Help us ride this wave by supporting XBS Marine Tech.
