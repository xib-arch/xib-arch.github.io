        <p> 1: First, we started by creating our logo using a program called Designer 2. We played around with shapes, fonts, and layout ideas until we had something good. Then we saved the file as a PNG so we could use it with the Cricut. </p>
      <p>2: Secondly, we went to the Cricut website and opened Design Space. We uploaded our logo file and used the tools there to clean it up and get it ready to cut. We made sure to size it properly and selected cut image so the Cricut knew what to do.</p>
      <p>3: Then, we picked the material we wanted like vinyl/sticker paper and stuck it onto the cutting mat. Then we loaded it into the Cricut Maker and chose the right settings for the material we were using.</p>
      <p>4: After that, we clicked Make It, and the Cricut cut out our logo for us. After it finished, we carefully removed the extra pieces of material (this part is called weeding) so only our logo was left.</p>
      <p>5: Lastly, we used transfer tape to stick our logo onto our final surface.</p>
